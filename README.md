# Expense Tracker Application

## Project Description

The Expense Tracker is a Python-based application developed using PyQt6 for the GUI and SQLite for data storage.

- **Add Expense:** Add details of a new expense, including Date, Category, Amount, and Description.
- **Delete Expense:** Delete any expense from the list with a single click.
- **View Expenses:** All expenses are displayed in a sortable table for easy review.
- **Persistent Data Storage:** All data is stored in an SQLite database for reliability.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **PyQt6** (GUI Framework)
- **SQLite** (Database)
